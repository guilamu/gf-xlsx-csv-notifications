# Gravity Forms - XLSX to CSV Notifications

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/guilamu/gf-xlsx-csv-notifications?color=blue)](https://github.com/guilamu/gf-xlsx-csv-notifications/releases) [![License: AGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL--3.0-green.svg)](LICENSE.txt) [![WordPress: 5.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/WordPress-5.8%2B-blue.svg)](https://wordpress.org) [![PHP: 7.4+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7.4%2B-purple.svg)](https://php.net)

Converts XLSX files uploaded through Gravity Forms into CSV and attaches both the CSV and the original XLSX to your notification emails.

## Per-Form Settings

Each form gets an **XLSX to CSV** tab under its settings (**Forms → your form → Settings → XLSX to CSV**). The plugin detects every file upload field in the form and exposes, per field:

- **CSV only (drop XLSX)** — attach only the converted CSV, leaving the original XLSX out of the notification
- **CSV delimiter** — semicolon, comma, tab, or pipe
- **Converted worksheet** — which worksheet to convert (1 = first sheet)

No code required — the options that used to live behind filters are now point-and-click, and configurable independently for each upload field.

## XLSX to CSV Conversion

- Convert the chosen worksheet of every uploaded `.xlsx` file to CSV (first sheet by default)
- Generate Excel-friendly output: configurable delimiter (semicolon by default) and UTF-8 BOM so accented characters open correctly
- Reuse cached conversions: a CSV is regenerated only when the source XLSX or its settings change
- Run everything locally with the bundled SimpleXLSX library (MIT) — no external service involved

## Notification Attachments

- Attach the generated CSV (and, by default, the original XLSX) to Gravity Forms notification emails
- Match single and multi-file upload fields, including GP File Upload Pro — with no dependency on it
- Fine-tune each upload field from the form settings, or target whole forms/notifications with dedicated filters
- Trace every conversion and error through the Gravity Forms logging system

## Key Features

- **Zero Configuration:** Activate the plugin and every notification of forms with file upload fields is covered; per-field options are optional
- **Per-Field Control:** A settings tab on each form to tune attachment, delimiter and worksheet for every upload field
- **Multilingual:** Works with content in any language
- **Translation-Ready:** All strings are internationalized (French translation included)
- **Secure:** Uploaded file URLs are resolved with path-traversal protection, confined to the Gravity Forms upload directory
- **GitHub Updates:** Automatic updates from GitHub releases

## Requirements

- Gravity Forms 2.5 or higher
- WordPress 5.8 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher

## Installation

1. Upload the `gf-xlsx-csv-notifications` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
3. Nothing else to configure: XLSX files uploaded through any form with a file upload field are converted and attached to its notifications

## FAQ

### Does it require GP File Upload Pro?

No. The plugin hooks into the standard `gform_notification` filter and works with any Gravity Forms file upload field, single or multi-file. GP File Upload Pro is supported but not required.

### Can I enable the conversion for specific forms or notifications only?

Yes, use the `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_enabled` filter:

```php
add_filter( 'gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_enabled', function( $enabled, $notification, $form ) {
    return (int) $form['id'] === 12; // only form 12
}, 10, 3 );
```

### Can I attach the CSV only, without the original XLSX?

Yes. Open **Forms → your form → Settings → XLSX to CSV** and enable **CSV only (drop XLSX)** for the relevant upload field. It is configurable per field.

### Can I change the CSV delimiter or the converted worksheet?

Yes, in the same **XLSX to CSV** form settings tab: pick the **CSV delimiter** (semicolon, comma, tab or pipe) and the **Converted worksheet** number (1 = first sheet) for each upload field.

### Can I exclude a specific upload field?

Yes, use the `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_field_enabled` filter:

```php
add_filter( 'gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_field_enabled', function( $enabled, $field ) {
    return (int) $field->id !== 7;
}, 10, 2 );
```

### Can I change how dates are formatted in the CSV?

Yes, use the `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_date_format` filter. It receives a [PHP `date()` format string](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php) (default `d/m/Y`) and the source XLSX path:

```php
add_filter( 'gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_date_format', function( $format, $xlsx_path ) {
    return 'd/m/Y H:i:s'; // keep the time, e.g. for a genuine timestamp column
}, 10, 2 );
```

### Where can I see what was converted or why a file was skipped?

Enable Gravity Forms logging (**Forms → Settings → Logging**): the plugin logs every attachment and every conversion error there.

## Limitations

- Only `.xlsx` files are converted; the legacy `.xls` format is not supported by SimpleXLSX
- One worksheet per CSV: the first sheet by default, or another one chosen per field in the form settings
- Conversion happens when a notification is sent, not at upload time

## Changelog

### 1.1.4 - 2026-07-08
- Fixed: the add-on title and the **XLSX to CSV** form settings tab label were hardcoded in English and never passed through the i18n functions, so they ignored the French translation. They are now translated once the textdomain is loaded

### 1.1.3 - 2026-07-06
- Fixed: fields set to **CSV only (drop XLSX)** could still end up with the XLSX attached, because Gravity Forms' own "Attach uploaded files to notification" option runs after this plugin's filter and re-added it. A new `gform_pre_send_email` hook now runs last, dropping the XLSX for "CSV only" fields and de-duplicating attachments right before the email is sent

### 1.1.2 - 2026-07-06
- Fixed: date cells were converted using a fixed `Y-m-d H:i:s` format (e.g. `1979-09-17 00:00:00`) instead of matching how Excel displays the date. Dates are now written as `d/m/Y` by default; use the new `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_date_format` filter to change the format (e.g. keep the time for genuine timestamp columns)

### 1.1.1 - 2026-07-06
- The **Converted worksheet** field now rejects 0 and negative values (1 = first sheet): the number input enforces a minimum of 1 client-side, snapping back to 1 if cleared or set below 1

### 1.1.0 - 2026-07-06
- Added a per-form **XLSX to CSV** settings tab that detects every file upload field and exposes, per field: CSV only (drop XLSX), CSV delimiter, and converted worksheet (1 = first sheet)
- Replaced the `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_attach_original`, `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_delimiter` and `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_sheet_index` filters with these UI settings
- Cache filename now accounts for delimiter/worksheet so changing a setting regenerates the CSV instead of reusing a stale one
- Kept the `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_enabled` and `gf_xlsx_csv_notifications_field_enabled` filters as programmatic escape hatches

### 1.0.0 - 2026-07-04
- Initial release
- XLSX to CSV conversion (first worksheet, semicolon delimiter, UTF-8 BOM) attached to Gravity Forms notifications
- Optional attachment of the original XLSX file
- Filters to target forms, notifications and fields, and to change delimiter and worksheet
- Automatic updates from GitHub releases
